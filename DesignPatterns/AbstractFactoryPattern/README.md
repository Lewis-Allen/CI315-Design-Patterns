# Abstract Factory Pattern

The Abstract Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes (Gang of Four).

In this example, a simple chocolate factory has been designed. Concrete factories have been create for both the White and Dark chocolate types. This allows chocolate bars and easter eggs to be created using a factory without specifying the type of the concrete class.
